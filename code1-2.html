    <h1>Revelation</h1>
    <h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
    <p>
        We make ourselves a place apart <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Behind light words that tease and flout, <br />
        But oh, the agitated heart <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Till someone find us really out. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        'Tis pity if the case require <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Or so we say) that in the end <br />
        We speak the literal to inspire <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The understanding of a friend. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        But so with all, from babes that play <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At hide-and-seek to God afar, <br />
        So all who hide too well away <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Must speak and tell us there they are. <br />
    </p>
